## âœ… Introduction

The **Go-Book-Store-App** is a full-stack application that allows users to interact with a list of books. It demonstrates:
- **REST API development** using Go with the `gorilla/mux` router.
- **Dynamic Frontend** built with Next.js (15.1.0) using the App Router.
- Integration between the frontend and backend using `fetch` for API calls.

This project is perfect for beginner-to-intermediate developers looking to understand full-stack development.

## âœ… Features

### Backend
- **REST API Endpoints**:
  - `GET /books`: Fetch all books.
  - `GET /books/{id}`: Fetch a specific book by ID.
  - `POST /books`: Add a new book.
  - `PUT /books/{id}`: Update a book by ID.
  - `DELETE /books/{id}`: Delete a book by ID.
- Mock database with predefined book data.
- **CORS support** for seamless frontend-backend integration.

### Frontend
- **Dynamic Fetching** of book data using `fetch` in React (`useEffect`).
- Styled with **Tailwind CSS**.
- Routes built using the Next.js **App Router**.

## âœ… Technologies Used

- **Go**: Backend API development.
- **gorilla/mux**: Routing for the Go server.
- **Next.js**: Frontend development with React and the App Router.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application (planned for future).

## âœ… Installation

### Backend
1. Install Go: https://golang.org/dl/
2. Clone the repository and navigate to `/bookstore-api`.
3. Run the backend server:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
Frontend
Install Node.js: https://nodejs.org/
Navigate to /bookstore-frontend.
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install
Run the development server:
bash
Copy code
npm run dev

Endpoints
HTTP Method	Endpoint	Description
GET	/books	Fetch all books.
GET	/books/{id}	Fetch a book by ID.
POST	/books	Add a new book.
PUT	/books/{id}	Update an existing book.
DELETE	/books/{id}	Delete a book by ID.
Each endpoint is handled in the handlers/books.go file.

âœ… Frontend Development
Fetching and Displaying Books
The Bookstore component in bookstore-frontend/app/bookstore.tsx fetches book data from the backend API. See code in /bookstore-frontend/app/bookstore.tsx.

ðŸš€ Future Development Plan
Containerization: Use Docker to containerize the frontend and backend.
Database Integration: Replace the mock database with MongoDB.
Advanced Features:
User authentication.
Search and filtering for books.
Deployment: Deploy the app using NGINX and AWS/Netlify.
ðŸš€ Deployment Instructions (Planned)
Configure NGINX as a reverse proxy for both frontend and backend.
Set up the app on a live server using Docker containers.
ðŸš€ CI/CD Workflow
GitHub Actions Workflow
We will create a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions:

Backend Testing: Run unit tests for the Go backend.
Frontend Testing: Run linting and unit tests for the frontend.
Deployment: Automatically build and deploy Docker containers.
ðŸš€ Project Board Flow
Use the GitHub project board to manage tasks:

Backlog: For new features and ideas.
Ready: Tasks ready to be worked on.
In Progress: Actively developed tasks.
In Review: Tasks under code review.
Done: Completed tasks.
